//We are given a school. 
//In the school there are classes of students. 
//Each class has a set of teachers. 
//Each teacher teaches a set of disciplines.
//Students have name and unique class number.
//Classes have unique text identifier. 
//Teachers have name. 
//Disciplines have name, number of lectures and number of exercises. 
//Both teachers and students are people. 
//Students, classes, teachers and disciplines could have optional comments (free text block).
	//Your task is to identify the classes (in terms of  OOP) and their attributes and operations, encapsulate their fields, define the class hierarchy and create a class diagram with Visual Studio.
